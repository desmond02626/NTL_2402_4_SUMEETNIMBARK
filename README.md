stock market analysis
The dataset showcases the behavior of shares from Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, and Google during February to May 2023. Here are some key takeaways:

Long Opportunities: Based on average price movements from the beginning of the period, Apple, Microsoft, and Google offered the best opportunities for long operations, particularly from March onwards.

Netflix Shorting: Netflix was a prime candidate for shorting in the first quarter, with a buying opportunity arising in early March when it broke resistance at around $340.

Moving Average Analysis: Using moving averages, support and resistance points were identified, indicating buying (long) or selling (short) opportunities.

Price Correlation: Apple and Microsoft had the highest price correlation, followed by Google and Microsoft. Netflix showed the least correlation, making it a good choice for portfolio diversification.

Volume and Price: Apple, Google, and Netflix exhibited a negative correlation between closing price and volume, while Microsoft showed a slight positive correlation. This suggests that volume alone isn't a strong indicator of price movement but can be useful when combined with price fluctuations for identifying trading opportunities.

Monthly Price Trends: All analyzed companies experienced a price decline in February. Apple, Microsoft, and Netflix had notable price spikes in May and March, respectively. Netflix, however, performed the worst on average, with consistent negative trends except for March.

Volatility: Netflix and Microsoft showed the highest volatility, offering greater speculative opportunities for short-term trading, despite the higher risk involved.

The analysis suggests that short-term speculative investors would benefit most from these findings. However, long-term value investors should incorporate broader economic factors into their fundamental analysis, beyond just price action.
